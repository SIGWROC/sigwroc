    The Writing and Rhetoric of Code group was established to bring together
    rhetoric, writing studies, and literacy scholars invested in the critical
    social and cultural aspects about coding and software. 


    WROC meets annually at the Conference on College Composition and Communication. In 2022, we are meeting on Wednesday (03/16) at 6:00pm EST. **Register for the meeting by filling out this [survey](https://t.co/LcJt4hmN0x)**.


    To help stabilize this subfield, we are building a WROC [bibliography](bibliography/) for the discipline, a [mentorship program](mentoring/) for scholars, and offering a space to share their [projects](projects/) to support our community. 


    If you're interested in joining the WROC mailing list for updates, please contact the Communications Officer: Cara Marta Messina at cmessina@jsu.edu
