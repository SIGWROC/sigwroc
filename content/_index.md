    The Writing and Rhetorics of Code group was established to bring together rhetoric, writing studies, and literacy scholars invested in all things coding and programming. WROC meets annually at the Conference on College Composition and Communication. 
    
    
    We are in the process of building WROC bibliographies, a mentorship program, and so much
    more to support our community. 


    If you're interested in joining the WROC mailing list for updates, please contact the Communications Officer: Cara Marta Messina at cmessina@jsu.edu
