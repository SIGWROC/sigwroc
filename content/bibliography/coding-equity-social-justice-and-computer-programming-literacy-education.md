annotation: This analysis revealed how coding workshops and bootcamps operate as
  literacy sponsors, contributing to a transformative access for participants.
  More specifically, my research describes how activist programmers craft open,
  inclusive, and culturally aware pedagogies by attending to access,
  representation, community, and active learning, ultimately facilitating an
  affective coding literacy.
