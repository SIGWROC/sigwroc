annotation: "This article discusses the US governmentâ€™s incorporation of social
  media in the background investigation process and notes the absence of
  discourse about the potentially problematic connection between social media
  platform algorithms and the US government's  targeted but widespread
  collection of social media data on potential clearance holders and their
  social circle. It offers an explanation of why congress did not address deeper
  privacy issues related to algorithms. "
