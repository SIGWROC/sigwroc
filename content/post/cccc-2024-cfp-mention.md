We're thankful to 4Cs Program Chair Dr. Sano-Franchini for the shoutout in her CFP about "[Writing Abundance](https://cccc.ncte.org/cccc/call-2024)"! It's a testament to the dedication of all of you WROC-ers who are helping stabilize us as a subfield in our discipline.

As a collective, we've worked together to establish of the following items since 2017:

1. establish a formal and elected committee, 
2. create and update a public [bibliography](/bibliography), 
3. propose and meet regularly at 4cs, and 
4. create programs like the informal mentoring group, [WROC and Write!](/mentoring), and workshops, such as "[Web Scraping with Python](/wrocshops)" 

These actions have already created new research collaborations, and I've heard stories about the usefulness of the bibliography for exam lists and their research. And, this momentum moves us closer towards Standing Group status, so we can be assured to have a reserved spot on the schedule. We see these two simple, but integral first steps, as a means to advertize and stabilize our presence at 4Cs and across the discipline.

Thank you all for your continued support, and we hope to see you at our next SIG meeting in Spokane, WA.

Sincerely,

Chris Lindgren | Chair and Founder of SIGWROC

p.s. Stay tuned! We're almost ready to announce our election results for the Communications Officer, At-Large Member, and Graduate-Student Member positions.
