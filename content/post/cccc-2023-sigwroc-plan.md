### Agenda

#### Introduction (~5-7 minutes)

#### Updates (~5-7 minutes)

- Elections: Grad student, Comm Officer, and At-Large Member

- Web Scraping Workshop Series

#### “Doing [Intersectional] Hope” Invention Activity (~40 minutes)

**Goal**: Generate important values, ideas, and directives to guide the SIGWROC field in our research, teaching, and service.

**How**: Apply Collins’ (*Black Feminist Thought*, 1990/2008) matrix of domination (types of power) to support a large group invention activity. The plan will be to use the framework to identify issues of power related to code, data, algorithms, etc. and their oppositions as a means to envision a more just future to work for. 

We will take up the following 4 MoD parts to organize our discussion:

- *Hegemonic*: What dominant ideas and values inform and maintain oppressive conditions and practices?
- *Structural*: What institutions, groups, communities, etc. organize enact such hegemony? Experience hegemony?
- *Interpersonal*: Based on one’s positionality, what types of everyday situations are organized and produced by this organization and enaction of power?
- *Disciplinary*: What rules (norms, policies, protocols, procedures, etc.) do different people experience differently, due to the above relationships?

We will use large post-its and sharpies to log ideas, along with the meeting minutes.

#### Hang Out! 

Let’s go hang out! :-)
