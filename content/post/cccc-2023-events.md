### J.25 Computing between Languages and Mathematics:

Technical and Professional Writing of Grace Murray Hopper and Winifred “Tim” Asprey” Centering the 1960s friendship of Grace Murray Hopper and Winifred “Tim” Asprey, this paper reframes public advocacy for computers as technical and professional communication. Disagreeing about the value of formal writing instruction, their work is approached not only through public understandings of science—especially, computer science—but also public understandings of writing.
