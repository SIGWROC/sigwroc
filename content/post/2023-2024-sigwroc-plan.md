  We outline our plans for the 2023-2024 academic year.
---

Below we outline our ongoing programs and projects, which includes some new goals aligned with out proposed plan for our 2024 annual meeting.

## Programs

- Mentorship Program
- WROC and Write events: We will continue these low-stakes writing meetings, which have been so important individually to keep ourselves accountable and carve out time to write. But, it also has been a way to build our community, as well as share our ideas and questions with each other.
- WROC Shops: We want to spread your knowledge and skills! Reach out to us if you want to put on a workshop that can also be placed under the banner of our subfield!
- CCCC Annual Conference Meeting: Continue our vision to work towards CCCC Standing Group status, so we can guarantee a sponsored panel each year.

## Projects

Many of the projects below are meant to communicate how we, as a field, have been and are continuing to do WROC work. The website has been a pivotal piece for us to communicate our research and teaching presence for ourselves and to others across the discipline.

- Update our Mission Statement/Principles Statement with the past 2 years of meeting notes as material to inform our directions and plans.
- Annotate and add to our [Bibliography](/bibliography). This is also our proposed focus of the 2024 4Cs SIG meeting.
- Publish members' teaching information and course descriptions to promote and make our contributions more visible. This has been a long-time goal among our members from the beginning.
- Document officer roles and create onboarding documentation to help make explicit the vision and logistics of SIGWROC for any incoming leadership.

## Other Goals

Among and across the above projects and programs, we hope to accomplish the following goals:

- Increase our members
- Build community through our low-stakes programs that strategically build on work and projects that members are already doing.
- Keep establishing ethos within the discipline
- Hold a symposium in the future (5-year plan perhaps)

If you have any questions or want to get involved with any of the plans outlined above, please feel free to contact Chris Lindgren at lindgren@vt.edu.

Thank you all!

Sincerely,

Chris Lindgren | Chair and Founder of SIGWROC
