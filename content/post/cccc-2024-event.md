## Special Interest Group Writing and Rhetoric of Code at CCCCs

Dear colleagues,

The Special Interest Group Writing and Rhetoric of Code (SIGWROC) will be hosting its annual meeting at the Conference on College Composition and Communication!

The Writing and Rhetoric of Code (WROC) group was established in 2017 to bring together rhetoric, writing studies, and literacy scholars invested in critical social and cultural aspects about coding and software.

- **Date**: April 5, 2024
- **Time**: 3:30-4:30 PM PDT
- **Location**: Spokane Convention Center, Lower Level, Room 303 A/B
- **Zoom Link**: [https://arizona.zoom.us/j/81197721082](https://arizona.zoom.us/j/81197721082)

During our annual meeting, we will continue to discuss and workshop our SIGâ€™s current bibliography project (wroc.netlify.app/bibliography). Our goal is to capture the abundance of the work being done in this growing subfield and specifically how this work is guided by our commitments to socially just research, teaching, and outreach. We will also discuss nominations for new chair and associate chair positions.

You can register for our annual meeting here: [https://forms.gle/uLsW2CVMR36LzUNT6](https://forms.gle/uLsW2CVMR36LzUNT6).

Take care,

Maggie Fernandes on behalf of the SIGWROC Co-Organizers
