      For over 30 years, writing and rhetoric scholars have explored
      the  relationships between programming, writing, and rhetoric. This
      body  of work has built from the premise that code is writing: it has
      dynamic  purposes, authors, and audiences both human and machine. Out of
      this  legacy, a growing number of scholars are actively conducting
      research  and developing pedagogies rooted in understanding the
      communicative and  rhetorical dimensions of computer programming. As a
      means to sustain this  scholarly community, we formed a NCTE/CCCC Special
      Interest group in 2017, so we could solidify our field and presence across
      the discipline.
