      One narrative has been shared among us repeatedly over the years: it's
      hard to find other colleagues who truly understand the nuance of studying
      programming cultures and teaching about them. An integral way that SIGWROC
      intends on stabilizing our subfield within the broader discipline is to
      support anyone who finds themselves in need of help not available within
      their existing programs.


      To help with this persistent issue, we are implementing the following programs below.

      **When**: New dates and times TBA


      **Where**: Zoom link TBA


      As part of our new mentorship program, SIGWROC will be hosting a series of writing-focused meet ups to help mentors and mentees connect in a low stakes way. 


      We are thrilled to begin more formal support for a WROC mentorship program. To get us started, we are hosting monthly *WROC and Write*! events on the first Fridays of the month. In each meeting, we will: 


      What we'll do:


      * Have focused time to write, read, or work on a project

      * Meet others working on projects in the writing and rhetorics of code

      * Have small breakout rooms with mentors to chat


      Use this [Google Survey](https://forms.gle/58DXhZyn1tQCDRhZA) (https://forms.gle/58DXhZyn1tQCDRhZA) to sign up to receive the Zoom link for these meetings.
