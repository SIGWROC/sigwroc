    text: "One narrative has been shared among us repeatedly over the years: it's
      hard to find other colleagues who truly understand the nuance of studying
      programming cultures and teaching about them. An integral way that SIGWROC
      intends on stabilizing our subfield within the broader discipline is to
      support anyone who finds themselves in need of help not available within
      their existing programs. If you need any support, we have mentors that
      would love to help you develop your research and teaching agendas. Review
      the list of scholars below and don't hesitate to reach out to them to
      start a conversation. We are here for you!"
